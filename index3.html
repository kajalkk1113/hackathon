<strong><u>Method</u></strong>

    <p>

<b>1. Prepare the Dough:</b>

<li>In a large bowl, mix maida (flour) and semolina (sooji).</li>

<li>Add ghee and salt, and rub it in with your fingers until it's crumbly.</li>

<li>Slowly add water and knead into a smooth, soft dough.</li>

<li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and set it aside to rest for about 30 minutes.</li>

</p>

<p>
<b>2. Prepare the Filling:</b>

<li>Heat 1 tbsp ghee in a pan and add grated khoya (mawa). Roast it on low flame until it turns slightly golden and releases a nice aroma.</li>

<li>Add grated coconut, chopped nuts, and raisins, and saut√© for 2-3 minutes.</li>

<li>Add cardamom powder and powdered sugar, and mix well. Let the mixture cool completely.</li>
</p>

<p>
<b>3. Shape the Gujiya:</b>

<li>Divide the dough into small equal-sized balls (about 12-15).</li>

<li>Roll each ball into a small flat circle (about 4-5 inches in diameter) using a rolling pin.</li>

<li>Place a spoonful of the prepared filling in the center of each circle. Be careful not to overfill.</li>

<li>Fold the circle into a half-moon shape, pressing the edges together tightly to seal.</li>

<li>You can press the edges with a fork or twist them to make a decorative pattern (this helps in sealing too).</li>
</p>

<p>
<b>4. Fry the Gujiya:</b>

<li>Heat oil or ghee in a deep pan on medium heat.</li>

<li>Carefully drop the gujiyas into the hot oil, a few at a time.</li>

<li>Fry them on medium flame until they turn golden brown and crispy (about 5-6 minutes).</li>

<li>Remove and drain excess oil on paper towels.</li>
</p>

<p>
<b>5. Serve:</b>

<li>Let the gujiyas cool slightly before serving.</li>

<li>You can also dip them in sugar syrup (optional) or garnish with pistachios or rose petals for extra richness.</li>
