</p>

<p>
<strong>Spices & simmer:</strong>

<li>Add turmeric powder, coriander powder, red chili powder, and salt. Mix well.</li>

<li>Add the cooked chickpeas and a bit of water to get the desired gravy consistency.</li>

<strong>Method for bhature:</strong>

<li>In a large mixing bowl, combine maida, sooji, baking powder, and salt.</li>

</p>

<p>
<strong>Rest the dough:</strong>

</p>

<p>
<strong>Fry the Bhature:</strong>

<li>Heat oil in a pan or wok for deep frying.</li>
